                <h2>10. Constitutional Authority</h2>
                <p>Under the Instrument of Government, the Council of Wings is the only body empowered to pass legislation, approve budgets, and amend the Constitution. All other institutions—the Government, Judiciary, and Ministries—operate under its laws. The Council may:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enact ordinary laws by majority vote.</li>
                    <li>Amend the Constitution with a supermajority and subsequent Council ratification.</li>
                    <li>Declare national emergencies (two-thirds vote required).</li>
                    <li>Approve or withdraw recognition of foreign states and treaties.</li>
                    <li>Authorize elections and referenda.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Council's authority is supreme but bound by law, ensuring power remains both democratic and limited.</p>

                <h2>11. Transparency and Public Access</h2>
                <p>The Council operates under the Transparency Principle:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All minutes, voting records, and bills are publicly accessible via the Government Gazette.</li>
                    <li>Sessions are open for observation by citizens and foreign guests.</li>
                    <li>Non-public sessions are strictly limited to matters of national security or privacy.</li>
                    <li>Citizens may request transcripts, submit petitions, and propose legislation.</li>
                    <li>Every decision is documented to preserve accountability and historical accuracy.</li>

                <h2>12. Symbolism and Identity</h2>
                <p>The Council of Wings takes its name from the pigeon, the national symbol of peace, unity, and vigilance. Each member represents a "wing" of the Republic — distinct yet working in harmony to sustain flight.</p>
                
                <div class="oath-box">
                    "I pledge to uphold the Constitution, serve the Republic, and protect the people of Pigeonaria with honor and integrity."

                <p>The Council Chamber, located in Featherhold, serves as both a legislative hall and a symbol of civic equality. Its seal features three wings encircling the national emblem, representing law, order, and freedom.</p>

                <h2>13. Relationship with Citizens</h2>
                <p>Citizens are encouraged to engage directly with the Council through:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Petitions and Citizen Initiatives on national issues.</li>
                    <li>Referenda for major constitutional or diplomatic questions.</li>

                    <li>Participation in committees or advisory panels on cultural, scientific, or local affairs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Council's legitimacy derives entirely from this active civic participation. No law or policy may be enacted without the foundation of public consent.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>With the Judiciary:</strong> The Council passes laws, but courts interpret them. The Constitutional Court can strike down Council acts that violate the Constitution.</li>
                    <li><strong>With the Government (Executive):</strong> The Council grants or withdraws confidence in the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. The government must report on all major decisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>With Oversight Bodies:</strong> The High Commissioner and Ombudsman report annually to the Council, ensuring ongoing accountability.</li>
                    <li><strong>With Local Governments:</strong> Regional and municipal councils operate under national law but enjoy local autonomy as granted by the Council.</li>

                <p>As of 2026, the Council of Wings is in its foundational period, establishing parliamentary procedures, codifying electoral law, and preparing for the Republic's first democratic elections. Until a full electorate is achieved, interim members serve as stewards of the Constitution and custodians of national law.</p>
                <p>The Council is the centerpiece of Pigeonaria's democratic system, ensuring that every future government remains subject to law, citizen consent, and legislative oversight.</p>
