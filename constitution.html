                    <p>ADOPTED BY THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY</p>
                    <p><strong>EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY</strong></p>
                </div>

                <h2>CHAPTER 1: FOUNDATIONS OF THE STATE</h2>
                
                <h3>Art. 1. Sovereignty of the People</h3>
                <p>All public power in the Democratic Republic of Pigeonaria derives from the people. Sovereignty belongs unconditionally to the citizenry.</p>
                
                <h3>Art. 2. Principles of the Republic</h3>
                <p>The Republic is founded upon the principles of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Free opinion and public debate</li>
                    <li>Universal and equal suffrage</li>
                    <li>Representative democracy through the Council of Wings</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Art. 3. Supremacy of Law</h3>
                <p>All public power is exercised under the Law. No individual, office, or institution may act above statutes enacted by the Council of Wings.</p>
                
                <h3>Art. 4. Separation of Powers</h3>
                <p>Legislative, Executive, and Judicial powers are separate, independent, and interdependent. No branch may unlawfully interfere with another.</p>

                <h2>CHAPTER 2: PROTECTION OF DEMOCRACY</h2>
                
                <h3>Art. 1. Parliamentary Confidence and Coalitions</h3>
                <p>The Government, led by the Prime Minister, must maintain the confidence of the Council of Wings.</p>
                <p>Political parties may form coalitions to establish a majority.</p>
                <p>A Vote of No Confidence may be initiated by any party or coalition. A simple majority vote against the Prime Minister dissolves the Government.</p>
                
                <h3>Art. 2. Constitutional Rigidity</h3>
                <p>Amendments to this Constitution require:</p>

                <p>The Council of Wings shall appoint a High Commissioner for Government Oversight, independent of political influence, with the authority to investigate any government agency or official. No document or communication shall be withheld under the "Transparency Principle."</p>
                <p>The High Commissioner shall be appointed for a non-renewable six-year term by a two-thirds vote of the Council upon nomination by a multi-party selection panel. Removal shall require an independent judicial finding of misconduct or incapacity. The High Commissioner's budget shall be protected by law and may not be reduced during their mandate.</p>
                
                <h3>Art. 4. Anti-Corruption and Oversight</h3>

                <h3>Art. 7. Independent Electoral Commission</h3>
                <p>An Independent Electoral Commission, appointed by a two-thirds vote of the Council of Wings on recommendation of a non-partisan selection panel, shall administer and supervise all national elections and referenda.</p>
                <p>Members shall serve staggered six-year terms and may be removed only for cause by a three-quarters vote of the Council following a public hearing.</p>
                <p>The Commission shall maintain and audit voter rolls, ensure transparent counting procedures, and publish results publicly.</p>
                
                <h3>Art. 8. Campaign Finance and Transparency</h3>

                <h3>Art. 1. Absolute Freedoms</h3>

                <h3>Art. 2. Election of the Prime Minister</h3>
                <p>The Prime Minister is elected by the Council of Wings and must maintain majority support, which may include coalitions of multiple parties. Coalitions may form and dissolve as necessary, but the Prime Minister remains accountable to the Council.</p>
                
                <h3>Art. 3. Judicial Independence</h3>
                <p>Judges are independent, appointed for life, and may only be removed for cause through due process. The Judiciary ensures the Law remains separate from politics.</p>

                <h3>Art. 5. Emergency Limitations</h3>
                <p>In times of national emergency, the Government may issue temporary measures. Such measures require Council approval within 30 days and may never infringe on Fundamental Rights or the independence of the Judiciary.</p>
                <p>A national emergency may be declared only by the Council of Wings upon a two-thirds vote, limited to thirty days, and may be extended only by the same majority following judicial review confirming necessity and proportionality. All emergency decrees must be publicly reported and automatically expire if not renewed.</p>
                
                <h3>Art. 6. Legislative Terms</h3>
                <p>The term of the Council of Wings shall be four years, with general elections held within 60 days of the end of each term. The Council may be dissolved early only by a two-thirds vote or through a successful vote of no confidence that fails to produce a new government within 30 days.</p>

                <h3>Art. 1. Policy of Neutrality</h3>

                <h3>Art. 2. Amendment of Neutrality</h3>
                <p>Any decision to enter a full alliance or alter the neutrality policy requires the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all members of the Council of Wings in a quorum session.</p>
                
                <h3>Art. 3. International Cooperation</h3>
                <p>Pigeonaria may engage in diplomatic, economic, or humanitarian cooperation, provided no such agreement compromises the State's neutrality or constitutional principles.</p>
