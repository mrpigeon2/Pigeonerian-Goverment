                <p>The Democratic Republic of Pigeonaria operates as a representative democracy through the Council of Wings. However, when the government faces critical decisions where public opinion is uncertain, or when democratic principles are threatened, referendums serve as a vital tool for consulting the people and protecting our constitutional order.</p>

                <h2>What is a Referendum?</h2>
                <p>A referendum is a direct vote by citizens on a specific proposal or question. In Pigeonaria, referendums are not a form of direct democracy, but rather a consultative mechanism and emergency safeguard used when:</p>
                
                <h3>When Are Referendums Held?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Uncertain Policy Decisions:</strong> When the Council of Wings or Government needs public guidance on major issues where the best course of action is unclear</li>
                    <li><strong>Emergency Brake:</strong> When citizens need to intervene if anti-democratic forces attempt to undermine constitutional principles</li>
                    <li><strong>Major International Commitments:</strong> Decisions like joining international organizations where public opinion is essential</li>
                    <li><strong>Neutrality Policy:</strong> Any proposed change to Pigeonaria's neutral status requires Council approval and public consultation</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Important: Constitutional Amendments</h3>
                    <p>Constitutional amendments do NOT require referendums. Instead, they follow a rigorous process:</p>
                    <ol style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                        <li>Approval by majority of the current Council of Wings</li>
                        <li>A general election must be held</li>
                        <li>The newly elected Council must ratify the amendment</li>
                        <li>Public notice at least 60 days prior to the vote</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This ensures that constitutional changes have sustained democratic support across multiple election cycles, not just a single referendum vote.</p>

                <h2>Citizen Safeguard Mechanism</h2>
                <p>While Pigeonaria is primarily a representative democracy, citizens retain an important "emergency brake" power to protect democratic principles.</p>
                
                <h3>The Emergency Brake:</h3>
                <p>If anti-democratic forces gain power in the Council of Wings and attempt to undermine constitutional principles, citizens can petition for a referendum to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Challenge unconstitutional actions</li>
                    <li>Reject laws that threaten fundamental rights</li>
                    <li>Protect the democratic order</li>
                    <li>Preserve the rule of law</li>

                <ol style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                    <li><strong>Identify the Threat:</strong> Document how a government action or proposed law threatens democratic principles</li>
                    <li><strong>Gather Signatures:</strong> Collect signatures from a minimum threshold of registered voters</li>
                    <li><strong>Submit to Electoral Commission:</strong> The Independent Electoral Commission will verify the petition</li>
                    <li><strong>Constitutional Review:</strong> The Constitutional Court reviews whether the referendum is justified</li>
                    <li><strong>Referendum Vote:</strong> If approved, citizens vote to accept or reject the challenged action</li>

                    <h3>Protection Against Abuse</h3>
                    <p>The Constitutional Court ensures that the emergency brake mechanism is not abused for partisan purposes. It can only be used when genuine threats to democracy exist, not for routine political disagreements.</p>

                <h3>1. Announcement and Information Campaign</h3>
                <p>Once a referendum is scheduled, the Independent Electoral Commission oversees a fair information campaign. Both supporters and opponents have equal opportunity to present their arguments to the public.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Voting Period</h3>
                <p>All registered citizens are eligible to vote. Voting is conducted with the same transparency and security measures as general elections:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Secret ballot to protect voter privacy</li>
                    <li>Multiple voting methods for accessibility</li>
                    <li>Independent oversight and international monitoring</li>
                    <li>Transparent counting and public verification</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>3. Results and Implementation</h3>
                <p>Referendum results are binding. If approved by the required majority (and quorum, if applicable), the proposal becomes law or constitutional amendment. The Council of Wings and Government are obligated to implement the decision.</p>

                <p>Called by the Council of Wings or Government when facing major policy decisions where public opinion is needed. These help guide decision-making on complex or uncertain issues.</p>
                
                <h3>Emergency Brake Referendums</h3>
                <p>Triggered by citizen petitions when democratic principles are threatened. These serve as a safeguard against anti-democratic actions by those in power.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                
                <h3>Is Pigeonaria a direct democracy?</h3>
                <p>No. Pigeonaria is a representative democracy where the Council of Wings makes laws on behalf of the people. Referendums are consultative tools and emergency safeguards, not a form of direct democracy.</p>
                
                <h3>Can citizens propose any law through referendum?</h3>
                <p>No. Citizens cannot freely propose laws through referendum. The Council of Wings is the legislative body. However, citizens can petition for referendums when democratic principles are threatened or when the government seeks public guidance on major issues.</p>
                
                <h3>How are constitutional amendments made?</h3>
                <p>Constitutional amendments require approval by the current Council of Wings, followed by a general election, and then ratification by the newly elected Council. This ensures sustained democratic support across election cycles, not just a single referendum.</p>
                
                <h3>Who can vote in a referendum?</h3>
                <p>All registered citizens of Pigeonaria who meet the voting age requirement (18 years or older) are eligible to vote in referendums.</p>
                
                <h3>How is the result determined?</h3>
                <p>Most referendums require a simple majority (50% + 1) of valid votes cast. The Council of Wings determines whether the referendum result is binding or consultative when calling the referendum.</p>
                
                <h3>Can a referendum result be overturned?</h3>
                <p>Consultative referendums guide but do not bind the Council of Wings. Emergency brake referendums that protect democracy are binding. The Constitutional Court may review any referendum if it violates fundamental constitutional principles.</p>
                
                <h3>What happens if anti-democratic forces ignore a referendum?</h3>
                <p>The Constitutional Court and judiciary have the power to enforce referendum results that protect democratic principles. Ignoring such results would be unconstitutional and subject to legal remedy.</p>

                <h3>Representative Democracy First</h3>
                <p>Pigeonaria is governed by the Council of Wings, elected by the people to make decisions on their behalf. Referendums are not a substitute for representative democracy, but a safeguard to ensure the government remains accountable and democratic principles are protected.</p>
